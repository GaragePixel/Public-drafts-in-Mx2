## NARRATIVE ARC

### Episode 1 - Prologue: Summer Encounter
During summer vacation 1997, Ikari meets Katsuo who is lost, searching for the yokai museum. She immediately sees through his human disguise to his kitsune form but pretends not to notice. She guides him to the museum, fascinated by meeting a real kitsune. After they part ways, Ikari spends the rest of summer searching for him, developing feelings for this mysterious fox spirit.

### Episode 2: School Year Begins
Episode 2 requires significantly more complex implementation than the prologue due to multiple character introductions, location establishments, and narrative branches. Key implementation considerations include: Revengeful Girls Introduction, Classroom Dynamics, Locker Room Revelation, Stalker Investigation Arc
When school starts in September, Ikari is shocked to discover Katsuo in a female disguise as "Kazuko," the deputy leader of the feared Revengeful Girls gang. Ikari must navigate these complex identities while hiding her ability to see through his disguises. The school year begins with fifteen-year-old Hikari returning to her first-year high school class (高校1年生) where she immediately recognizes a new transfer student—a girl with distinctive green glasses called "Kazuko"—as Katsuo in disguise. Despite the perfect female appearance, Hikari's unique perception allows her to see through the illusion. Most unsettling is how everyone, including long-term teachers, seems to have memories of Kazuko having always attended their school, suggesting powerful memory manipulation. Hikari observes the dynamics between Kazuko, Megumi, and Akane, while concealing her knowledge of Katsuo's true nature. As Hikari observes the school dynamics, she receives a cryptic warning from Akane, a stoic kendo practitioner: "Be prepared to lose something to gain something else" when associating with the green-glasses girl. During morning assembly, Hikari notices "Kazuko" reciting traditional waka poetry under her breath—an unusual trait for a modern schoolgirl. Hikari must choose how to react to this recognition: staring in shock (risking Katsuo's suspicion), pretending not to notice (building trust), or demonstrating cultural knowledge by recognizing the poetry (establishing common ground). As autumn progresses, Ikari attempts to forge connections with both versions of Katsuo. During swimming class, his discomfort with water becomes apparent, giving Ikari an opportunity to help him. In the locker room, "Kazuko" discovers Ikari's chimera condition, creating a moment of mutual vulnerability. Meanwhile, Ikari continues researching kitsune lore and begins to understand Katsuo's dual life better. School events like the Cultural Festival create opportunities for interaction.
Hikari discovers that "Kazuko" is lieutenant to Megumi in a feared group called the "Revengeful Girls"—a vigilante gang of female students who target male students they deem deserving of punishment. During a hallway incident, Hikari witnesses their power dynamics: Megumi as the charismatic, aggressive leader; Kazuko as the strategic, composed advisor; and several loyal followers enforcing their will.
The gang operates with surprising autonomy, with teachers visibly intimidated by Megumi and deferring to her authority. Hikari must choose her reaction to their methods—display disapproval (moral stance but dangerous), remain neutral (gathering information), or express subtle approval (potential infiltration opportunity). Each response establishes her position in the school's social hierarchy and affects her relationship with both Megumi and Kazuko. Through careful observation, Hikari begins mapping the gang's territory, hierarchy, and rule system, learning that Megumi harbors a deep-seated hatred toward men with possible connections to right-wing political movements.
Academic life provides structured opportunities for Hikari to interact with "Kazuko" through laboratory partnerships and classroom assignments. These moments reveal the complex identity performance Katsuo maintains—perfect female mannerisms, excellent academic performance, and strategic social positioning. During these interactions, Hikari notices Kazuko occasionally displaying unexpected kindness contradicting the cold lieutenant persona she performs around Megumi.

### Classroom Dynamics
Academic life provides structured opportunities for Hikari to interact with "Kazuko" through laboratory partnerships and classroom assignments. These moments reveal the complex identity performance Katsuo maintains—perfect female mannerisms, excellent academic performance, and strategic social positioning. During these interactions, Hikari notices Kazuko occasionally displaying unexpected kindness contradicting the cold lieutenant persona she performs around Megumi.

Hikari also develops a deeper understanding of Akane, the solitary kendo practitioner she has secretly admired for years. Observing Akane during class, Hikari recalls their brief encounter the previous year and notices the yokai of loneliness surrounding the stoic girl. Meanwhile, Hikari must carefully navigate Megumi's group, choosing between keeping safe distance or careful observation to learn group dynamics. The classroom becomes a stage where multiple performances play out—Kazuko pretending to be human and female, Megumi establishing dominance, and Hikari hiding her knowledge of the supernatural.

### Locker Room Revelation
A pivotal moment occurs during swimming class when Hikari, habitually late to avoid exposing her body, encounters Kazuko alone in the changing room. In this rare private moment, Kazuko discovers Hikari's chimera different colored pigmentation that had made her a target of bullying years earlier. Instead of disgust or mockery, Kazuko shows unexpected compassion and interest. Hikari, feeling strangely safe, shares her history of bullying and isolation.

This vulnerable exchange creates an authentic connection between them, with both characters revealing parts of themselves they typically keep hidden. The moment is interrupted by Megumi's arrival, whose possessive behavior toward Kazuko becomes evident. Hikari observes the immediate shift in Kazuko's demeanor—from genuine interest to performed compliance—highlighting Katsuo's complex relationship with Megumi. This sequence establishes the locker room as a recurring location for private conversations, away from Megumi's surveillance.

### Stalker Investigation Arc
Curiosity about Katsuo's true purpose leads Hikari to begin a methodical investigation. After glimpsing him in male human form from a school window, she develops increasingly sophisticated surveillance techniques. She recruits various invisible yokai as informants (dust yokai, shadow yokai, wind yokai) by offering appropriate payments—candy, message delivery, shrine visits—establishing her ability to interact with supernatural beings beyond Katsuo.

Her stalking progresses from casual observation to organized surveillance, discovering Katsuo's regular museum visits, mysterious business meetings, and telephone cabin calls to report to his mother. Weekend surveillance reveals his visits to ancient bookstores and entertainment districts. The investigation culminates in the shocking discovery of Katsuo visiting love hotels with various women, where yokai invisible reports confirm he extracts memories or emotional energy from them—a predatory pattern suggesting he feeds on human experiences.

This revelation forces Hikari to make a critical decision: direct confrontation (high risk), continued observation (gathering more evidence), or emotional processing of her jealousy and fear. Each path creates dramatically different relationship dynamics and potential endings. The episode concludes with Hikari possessing crucial knowledge about Katsuo's true nature and activities, establishing an asymmetrical power dynamic that will drive the following episodes.
