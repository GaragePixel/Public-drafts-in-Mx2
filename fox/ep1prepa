## Purpose
This document provides a concise summary of key events in Episode 1: "PROLOGUE: SUMMER ENCOUNTER [July-August 1996]" to establish narrative foundation and character introduction patterns.

## Episode Summary

### Initial Meeting: Museum Direction-Giving
Fifteen-year-old Hikari encounters Katsuo on a summer day when he appears lost in the city. He holds a poorly-drawn map, searching for a small museum dedicated to yokai artifacts. Despite his human appearance, something about him seems otherworldly. Hikari, already knowledgeable about yokai folklore, offers to guide him to the museum. Their conversation remains casual as she maintains a friendly but reserved demeanor, though she immediately senses something unusual about the young man. The encounter culminates at the museum entrance where Katsuo thanks her politely before disappearing inside, leaving Hikari with an inexplicable sense that something significant has just occurred.

### True Form Recognition
During their walk to the museum, Hikari glimpses Katsuo's true kitsune form through his human illusion—a momentary shimmer revealing fox ears, multiple tails, and an otherworldly aura. However, she deliberately conceals this perception, showing no reaction and pretending to see only his human guise. This decision marks her first strategic choice regarding their relationship, as she instinctively understands that acknowledging his true nature might frighten him away. The moment creates a fundamental asymmetry in their relationship: Hikari knows what Katsuo is, but he remains unaware of her perception abilities, believing his disguise perfect.

### Summer Search Sequence
The encounter transforms Hikari's summer vacation into an obsessive search. She immerses herself in kitsune folklore research, studying historical yokai-human relationships, learning about kitsune weaknesses (water, dogs), and developing a deeper understanding of these supernatural beings. Her search becomes increasingly desperate as she:
1. Visits the yokai museum repeatedly, engaging with the caretaker while searching for glimpses of Katsuo
2. Returns to their meeting spot daily, sometimes waiting for hours
3. Stakes out a bus stop overnight on multiple occasions
4. Searches surrounding streets and neighborhoods for any sign of him

Each failed attempt deepens both her frustration and fascination, transforming a chance encounter into a driving obsession that begins reshaping her worldview.

### Emotional Impact & Transformation
The summer encounter fundamentally alters Hikari's perception of reality and herself. As a chimera who has always felt isolated due to her unusual skin patterns, the discovery of a yokai—a being far more different than she is—creates a profound sense of possibility. Her dreams become filled with kitsune imagery, and she begins noticing previously invisible yokai entities in everyday settings. The encounter serves as both validation of her uniquely sensitive perception and as catalyst for her growing understanding that the world contains dimensions beyond ordinary human experience. As summer ends and the new school year approaches, Hikari carries this knowledge with her, forever changed by the brief meeting, leaving behind "the memory of a past love, never realized, and forever regretted."

## Implementation Notes

### Brevity-Focused Introduction
The episode employs condensed narrative structure (only 5,100 words, 2.2% of total narrative) to establish essential components without extended exposition. This approach creates immediate engagement by focusing exclusively on critical elements: Hikari's perception abilities, Katsuo's hidden nature, and the fundamental connection between them. Secondary world-building elements are deferred to later episodes, maintaining focus on the core relationship foundation.

### Asymmetrical Knowledge Foundation
The episode establishes the critical knowledge imbalance that drives much of the subsequent narrative: Hikari recognizes Katsuo's true nature while he remains unaware of her perception abilities. This asymmetry creates immediate narrative tension and establishes Hikari's observational role that continues throughout the story. The implementation deliberately avoids overly detailed explanations of how her perception works, leaving room for gradual revelation in later episodes.

### Emotional Catalyst Architecture
Rather than implementing complete character backgrounds, the episode focuses on establishing emotional motivation—Hikari's profound sense of connection to someone who represents a world beyond ordinary human experience. This emotional foundation serves as catalyst for subsequent actions, creating narrative justification for her otherwise extreme behaviors (stalking, fake suicide attempt) in later episodes. The summer search sequence demonstrates her determination and establishes pattern recognition skills critical to later storylines.

## Technical Advantages

### Memory Establishment for Delayed Reunion
The episode's brevity creates stronger emotional impact for the delayed reunion in Episode 2. By establishing only the essential connection points without extended interaction, the narrative creates genuine longing that mirrors Hikari's experience. This implementation allows players to share her recognition moment when she sees "Kazuko" at school, creating synchronized emotional response between player and protagonist through shared memory reference points.

### Player-Character Knowledge Alignment
The episode deliberately aligns player knowledge with Hikari's perspective, creating identification through shared information advantage. Players learn about Katsuo's true nature simultaneously with Hikari, establishing narrative alliance that continues throughout the story. This implementation technique creates emotional investment through privileged information sharing, positioning players as co-conspirators in Hikari's subsequent plans rather than mere observers.

### Emotional Justification Framework
The episode provides essential emotional foundation for Hikari's extreme actions in later episodes, creating narrative justification for behaviors that might otherwise seem obsessive or unbalanced. By establishing the profound impact of the brief encounter, the narrative prepares players to accept increasingly dramatic actions as reasonable extensions of established emotional investment. This foundation creates coherent character psychology that supports even the most dramatic revelations in later episodes.

The prologue's condensed structure creates immediate engagement while establishing essential narrative elements that support the expanded episodes to follow, focusing on emotional connection rather than detailed exposition.
