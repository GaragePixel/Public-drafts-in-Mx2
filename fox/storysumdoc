EPISODE SUMMARY

1. EPISODE 1 (prologue): SUMMER ENCOUNTER [July-August 1996]
The story begins with Hikari's chance encounter with Katsuo at a local museum's yokai exhibit. Using her ability to see the invisible world of yokai, she discovers that Katsuo is a yokai hiding behind an illusion; she recognizes him as a kitsune. Missing an opportunity to establish contact with the kitsune, Hikari embarks on extensive research on kitsunes, visiting the museum several times in an attempt to find the mysterious boy, and searching the neighborhood for him, eventually staying up entire nights waiting for him to arrive. She then dreams of a kitsune just before the title of the work appears.

2. SCHOOL YEAR BEGINS: RECOGNITION [September 1996]
Summer is about to end. As the new school year approaches, Hikari meets Katsuo, albeit in a new illusion, "Kazuko," a female form. Simultaneously, we meet Megumi, the authoritarian student council president with political aspirations and manipulative tendencies, and Akane, a mysterious outsider. The school's social hierarchies develop as Hikari navigates her relationships with Kazuko and Megumi's faction. Seeking to meet Katsuo in his human form, as she did during their first encounter, Hikari's supernatural awareness intensifies through her encounters with minor yokai entities, such as dust spirits and shadow creatures, through whom she learns of Katsuo's nocturnal activities (sleeping with girls for one night only). She then has a choice: either she decides she can attempt a direct approach to obtain sexual favors from a magical being, or she tries to get closer to Katsuo through their brief exchanges in the locker room, where Katsuo (Kazuko) discovers she is a chimera.

3. SCHOOL FESTIVAL ARC [Culture Day - November 3, 1996]
The episode reaches its critical inflection point during the preparations for the Autumn Festival with the REFLECTION ON THE FESTIVAL MOON sequence. This pivotal moment imposes a three-way choice: share a spiritual moment with Hikari, witness the Megumi-Katsuo connection, or engage in solitary contemplation. This decision establishes the fundamental relationship triangle that influences all subsequent narrative paths and is the primary determinant of Katsuo's spiritual vulnerability or strength. During this episode, tensions at school intensify as Megumi shows a growing interest in Kazuko. We witness the gang's activities. Each character expresses a facet of the story in their performance at the festival. Akane is surprised in a moment of weakness by Hikari (Akane's Secret Breakdown).

4. INVESTIGATION & REVELATION [December 1996 - February 1997]
Growing Tensions with Revengeful Girls. Akane avoids Hikari, and Hikari tries to understand Katsuo's reason for being there and disguises himself as Kazuko. They meet briefly at New Year's (January 1, 1997), and here demonstrate why temples are a very lucrative business for the gangs of which Megumi is an extension. Growing Tensions with Revengeful Girls. Akane reconciles with Hikari, and their unspoken friendship deepens (but it can end tragically for the player). Perhaps Akane is the reason Katsuo is here? A rain of invisible yokai falls on the school (The Violent Confrontation). Hikari takes another step into the invisible world of the yokai while Akane will be suspended for three months from school for violence (Tanaka defeated). Megumi declares that she has found her "chosen one" in Akane. Katsuo shows dissonance with his illusion of Kazuko, and Hikari understands that Akane is not the reason the kitsune is here. 5. WHITE DAY CELEBRATIONS [March 1997]
Determined to discover the reason for his presence and also to connect with him as a yokai-kitsune, Hikari offers Katsuo fox-shaped chocolates and observes his reaction. She discovers that he's probably already attached to her, much more so than she had thought, and has an epiphany.

6. CRISIS POINT: THE REVELATION [April 1997]
Hikari then decides to go all out. In order to confess her feelings to Katsuo and connect with the reality of yokai like him, she uses her ability to see the invisible world of yokai to trick him into thinking she is going to commit suicide because of her delusion, which she had previously mocked at school. She manages to make him believe that she is depressed and arranges for him to follow her one evening, which he does. She then commits a fake suicide by throwing herself off a roof. Katsuo has no choice but to reveal himself as a kitsune if he wants to save her. She then explains to him that she is capable of seeing a world that he himself does not seem to know. She tells him that she wants to become a bridge between humans and yokai but above all, that she is in love with him, and that at least, she only asks for one thing: to spend a night of love with him. The transformative sequence follows: "Rooftop to Rooftop Journey," then "Night of Intimacy," with the detail of the tufts of hair in the basket she asks to be collected to make a scarf, and is realized in "Physical Intimacy," after which Katsuo has an epiphany: she is the one he is looking for, the one he wants as a companion. And the two quickly become engaged.

7. TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY [May 1997]
Preparing a trip to the hot springs resort run by Katsuo's mother in the mountains, Katsuo asks permission, as a seemingly human boy, to take his daughter with him, while, disguised as a work colleague, he improves the working conditions of his father, who is no longer "put by the window." At the hot springs, Hikari meets Katsuo's family, and also, in the nearby forest, a kodama who can give her answers about the origin or purpose of her gift to see the world of invisible yokai.

8. KODAMA TRANSFORMATION [June 1997]
Going to the tree, she begins a spiritual journey through her consciousness, capturing the essence of her unborn sister and transmuting it to become, thanks to Katsuo's tufts of hair, a true female kitsune. The two experience a moment of transfiguration where Hikari replicates her suicide by throwing herself off a cliff, once again being saved by Katsuo.

9. NEW EXISTENCE [July-August 1997]
Helped by Katsuo and Katsuo's vixen sister, Hikari begins a dangerous journey where she gradually embraces her new nature to transcend her identity and find her place in the universe.
