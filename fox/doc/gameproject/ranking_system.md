## Commentary and Critique

### **1. Originality**
- **Strengths**:
	1. **Dream Explication System**: The idea of dynamically generated dreams tied to player progress is highly original. It combines narrative depth with symbolic interpretation, providing a personalized and reflective experience. Few games blend mechanical systems with such abstract, almost poetic, storytelling elements.
	2. **Buzz Mechanism**: The subtle gamification of comments (e.g., adding visual effects for promotional buzz) is a clever and indirect way to encourage organic marketing without overtly pushing players.
	3. **Discord Integration**: While not groundbreaking, the opt-in approach to linking players to the Discord server and newsletter is well-executed. It aligns with the game's community-building ethos.
	4. **Telemetry Subpage**: Including a transparent explanation of telemetry data collection is a thoughtful touch, addressing potential player concerns about privacy.

- **Weaknesses**:
1. **Avatar Customization**:  
The inclusion of *purikura*-style avatars with unlockable elements is a delightful touch that reinforces the game’s artistic charm, though it may feel familiar to players accustomed to similar features in other games. To elevate this system, adding a mechanic that allows players to place cliparts manually on character drawings introduces a more interactive and creative layer. This enhancement aligns seamlessly with the *purikura* theme, enabling players to personalize their avatars with unique, self-expressive designs. While not a revolutionary concept, it caters to players who value individuality and creativity. The primary challenge would be to design an intuitive interface that makes customization enjoyable while ensuring that the cliparts remain thematically consistent with the game’s aesthetic.

2. **Ranking System Core**:  
The ranking system’s emphasis on proximity to the Perfect Ending and anonymized comparisons is functional but lacks the dynamic engagement found in more competitive or interactive leaderboard systems. Without additional mechanics to drive player excitement, such as challenges, time-based competitions, or cooperative ranking elements, the system risks being perceived as static. Exploring ways to diversify the ranking system or adding layers of interactivity could help make it more compelling and differentiated from standard implementations.

3. **Easter Egg Mechanics**:  
The hidden nature of certain mechanics, such as buzz effects and avatar marks, introduces a sense of discovery and intrigue. However, this approach may alienate players who prefer transparency or structured progression. To address this, introducing a mechanic where hints or "astuces" (e.g., "use this word and look how it will...") are unlocked through specific in-game paths could strike a balance between secrecy and accessibility. By tying these hints to narrative milestones or achievements, the system retains its mystery while rewarding players for exploration and engagement. This design ensures that the hidden mechanics remain an optional layer for curious players, while others are not left in the dark. The challenge lies in ensuring that these hints feel rewarding and optional rather than obligatory, maintaining the focus on player agency and discovery.
