## Purpose

This document outlines the branching scenarios in *Clannad*, focusing on how player decisions shape the narrative and lead to various character routes, arcs, and endings. This provides a detailed comparison to other visual novels, such as *Steins;Gate*, emphasizing *Clannad*'s unique approach to storytelling and structure.

## Narrative Overview

*Clannad* is a landmark visual novel that combines slice-of-life drama with emotional depth. The game is divided into two main parts:
1. **School Arc**: Focused on the protagonist's relationships and character routes during his time in high school.
2. **After Story**: A continuation of the narrative that explores adulthood, family, and the consequences of earlier choices.

The branching scenarios are driven by:
- **Character Routes**: Each character's route explores their personal struggles and development.
- **Light Orbs**: Key decisions reward the player with "Light Orbs," which are required to unlock the **True Ending**.
- **Multiple Endings**: Major and minor endings depend on the player's interactions and decisions.
