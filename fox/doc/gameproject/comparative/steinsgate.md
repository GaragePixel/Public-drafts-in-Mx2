## Purpose

This document outlines the branching scenarios in *Steins;Gate*, focusing on how player decisions affect the narrative and lead to multiple endings. The goal is to provide a detailed comparison for understanding the complexity and replayability of its narrative structure.

---

## Narrative Overview

*Steins;Gate* is renowned for its nonlinear storytelling, where player decisions primarily revolve around the use of the in-game mobile phone and the concept of worldlines. The narrative branches are driven by:

1. **Phone Trigger System**:
	- Player choices made through phone interactions (e.g., answering calls, replying to texts) determine the protagonist's actions.
	- These choices influence the timeline and lead to different worldlines.

2. **Worldline Divergences**:
	- The game is divided into distinct worldlines, each representing an alternate reality.
	- Shifting between worldlines alters the narrative, often drastically.

## List of Branching Scenarios

### **1. Prologue and Common Route**
- The story begins with a linear prologue, introducing the core plot of time travel and the consequences of altering the past.
- Branching begins as the player makes initial decisions via the phone.

---

### **2. Divergence Through D-Mail**
- **D-Mail Decisions**:
	- The player sends D-Mails (text messages to the past) that change key events in the timeline.
	- Each D-Mail shifts the player to a new worldline with unique outcomes.
	- Examples:
		- Preventing a character's death.
		- Altering someone's life path.

- **Branching Complexity**:
	- Each D-Mail affects the "Divergence Meter," which measures how far the player is from the original timeline.

---

### **3. Character Routes**
- The narrative branches into specific character routes based on worldline decisions:
	1. **Mayuri Route**:
		- Focuses on saving Mayuri from her fated death.
		- Choices revolve around loyalty and emotional bonds.
	2. **Kurisu Route**:
		- Centers on the relationship with Kurisu and the ethics of time travel.
	3. **Luka Route**:
		- Explores Luka's personal struggles and gender identity.
	4. **Faris Route**:
		- A lighthearted but emotionally impactful route centered on Faris' family and personal sacrifices.
	5. **Suzuha Route**:
		- A tragic route exploring Suzuha's mission and the consequences of failure.

---

### **4. Endings**
- **Multiple Endings**:
	- Each character route culminates in a unique ending based on the player's choices.
	- Examples:
		- **Mayuri Ending**: Sacrificing Kurisu to save Mayuri.
		- **Kurisu Ending**: Sacrificing Mayuri to save Kurisu.
		- **True Ending**: Achieved by triggering specific flags across all routes and reaching the Steins;Gate worldline.

- **True Ending Requirements**:
	- The player must carefully navigate through specific choices, responding to key phone interactions to unlock the "Steins;Gate" worldline.
	- Failure to meet these requirements results in a "normal" ending tied to one of the character routes.

## Notes on Implementation Choices

1. **Phone Trigger System**:
	- The reliance on subtle phone interactions adds depth and replayability, as players may not immediately realize the impact of their choices.

2. **Divergence Meter**:
	- A visual representation of worldline shifts helps players track their progress but does not explicitly reveal how to achieve certain endings.

3. **Character-Centric Routes**:
	- Each route provides meaningful character development, ensuring emotional engagement regardless of the player's path.

---

## Technical Advantages of Steins;Gate's Branching Design

1. **Replayability**:
	- The combination of multiple endings and subtle decision points encourages players to explore all routes.

2. **Emotional Depth**:
	- Character-specific routes ensure that every decision feels impactful, creating strong player investment.

3. **Nonlinear Complexity**:
	- The worldline system adds a layer of sophistication, making each playthrough feel unique.

## Conclusion

*Steins;Gate* exemplifies nonlinear storytelling through its branching worldlines and phone-triggered decisions. Its layered narrative structure makes it a benchmark for visual novels, offering both emotional depth and technical complexity.
