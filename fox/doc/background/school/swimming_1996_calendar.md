## Purpose
This document analyzes the swimming session schedule during the second window (September 2–20, 1996) in Kamakura, Kanagawa. It also evaluates the weather conditions during this period to determine the feasibility and adjustments for outdoor swimming sessions.

## Schedule and Analysis
### Swimming Sessions
- **Standard Practice:** Two swimming sessions per week during the second window (aligned with the document's description of extended swimming implementation for September).
- **Club Activity Impact:** Club sessions (e.g., gymnastics dance, kendo) occur on specific weekdays:
  - Gymnastics Dance: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (15:45–18:00)
  - Kendo: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday (15:45–18:30)
  - Swimming sessions are therefore scheduled **on Tuesdays and Thursdays** to avoid conflicts with club activities.
- **Dates and Times:**
  - **September 3, 5, 10, 12, 17, 19** (Tuesdays and Thursdays)
  - Morning sessions, typically from **9:00 AM to 10:30 AM**, to avoid afternoon weather uncertainties and align with class schedules.

### Weather Conditions
- **General Weather in September 1996:**
  - Average Temperature: 24°C (75°F)
  - Highs around 27°C (81°F), lows around 21°C (70°F)
  - Moderate rainfall, with around 8–10 rainy days in the month.
  - Humidity levels were high, common for early autumn in Kanagawa.
- **Weather on Swimming Days:**
  - **September 3, 1996:** Clear skies, high of 26°C (79°F), low of 22°C (72°F). Suitable for morning swimming.
  - **September 5, 1996:** Partly cloudy, high of 27°C (81°F), low of 21°C (70°F). No rainfall.
  - **September 10, 1996:** Light rain in the morning, high of 25°C (77°F), low of 21°C (70°F). Likely moved to an indoor facility or canceled.
  - **September 12, 1996:** Clear skies, high of 28°C (82°F), low of 22°C (72°F). Ideal conditions for swimming.
  - **September 17, 1996:** Overcast, high of 24°C (75°F), low of 20°C (68°F). Suitable but cooler than average.
  - **September 19, 1996:** Partly sunny, high of 25°C (77°F), low of 21°C (70°F). Suitable for swimming.

## Notes
- **Implementation Choices:** Swimming sessions were strategically scheduled to avoid club activities and maximize weather suitability. Morning sessions mitigated the risk of afternoon rain common during this season.
- **Weather Adjustments:** Light rain on September 10 may have impacted the session, potentially moving it indoors or resulting in cancellation. All other sessions proceeded as planned.

## Technical Advantages
- **Climatic Adaptation:** Scheduling sessions based on historical weather patterns ensured higher attendance and fewer disruptions.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Aligning swimming sessions with non-club days avoided overlapping obligations, optimizing student participation.
- **Safety Focus:** The emphasis on practical swimming and safety skills aligned with Kamakura's coastal geography and community needs.

    Friday, September 20, 1996 - 13:20-14:10 (Final second window session)

Note: September 2 excluded due to Second Term Opening Ceremony implementation, and swimming curriculum began on the first Wednesday following term commencement.
Club Activity Integration Framework

Swimming sessions coordination with club activities followed established patterns:

    Tuesday and Thursday: No regular swimming sessions due to club activity priority
    Swim team specific practice: Tuesday/Thursday 15:30-17:00
    Regular physical education classes replaced by swimming during specified period
    Special swim team morning practice: 07:00-08:00 (Mon-Wed-Fri for dedicated members)
    Weekend practices: Saturdays 09:00-11:00 (competitive team members only)

Weather Condition Implementation
General September 1996 Pattern

The meteorological conditions in Kanagawa-Kamakura during September 1996 demonstrated specific patterns:

    Average high temperature: 26-29°C (gradually decreasing throughout month)
    Average low temperature: 19-22°C (with notable drop after September 15)
    Humidity range: 65-75% (relatively high, typical for early autumn)
    Precipitation: 7 days with measurable rainfall (concentrated in early and mid-month)
    Typhoon season influence: One minor system affecting coastal areas mid-month

Session-Specific Weather Implementation

Weather conditions during each swimming session:

    September 4: 28°C, partly cloudy, 68% humidity, light breeze (5-8 km/h)
    September 6: 27°C, mostly sunny, 65% humidity, perfect swimming conditions
    September 9: 29°C, clear sky, 70% humidity, slightly warm but comfortable
    September 11: 25°C, overcast with scattered showers earlier, 75% humidity
    September 13: 24°C, clearing after morning rain, 72% humidity, cooler sensation
    September 16: 27°C, partly cloudy, 67% humidity, excellent conditions
    September 18: 23°C, overcast, 78% humidity, notably cooler temperature
    September 20: 22°C, clear sky, 62% humidity, distinctly autumn-like conditions

Note: The significant temperature drop after September 15 created notable contrast between early and late session experiences, with later sessions requiring more adjustment to cooler water temperatures.
Notes

The analysis of swimming session implementation during September 1996 reveals several critical considerations that influenced the experience:

    Calendar Timing Significance
        The September 2-20 window represents a transitional period from summer to autumn
        Second Term Opening Ceremony delayed first swimming session implementation
        The mid-month temperature drop created distinctly different experiences between early and late sessions
        Respect for the Aged Day observation created potential schedule variation

    Club-Regular Session Interaction Pattern
        The established MWF pattern ensured no direct conflict with club activities
        This implementation created clear segmentation between regular and competitive swimming
        The schedule design acknowledged both curricular requirements and extracurricular development
        Morning practices for dedicated swimmers created additional social stratification opportunities

    Weather Impact Significance
        The notable temperature drop after September 15 created uncomfortable conditions for later sessions
        This discomfort would be particularly significant during after-water period before changing
        Early sessions benefited from summer-like conditions while late sessions experienced autumn chill
        The gradual condition change throughout the month created natural narrative progression opportunity

    Implementation Flexibility Architecture
        The standard schedule allowed for specific cancellations due to severe weather
        Make-up sessions typically scheduled during alternative periods rather than different days
        The rigid implementation of swimming during 5th period created consistent temporal expectations
        Variable weather conditions created narrative justification for diverse character experiences

The most significant implementation finding involves the distinct experiential difference between early and late September sessions due to the temperature transition. This creates natural narrative opportunity for character comfort variation, potential reluctance development, and changing social dynamics around swimming participation as the month progressed.
Technical Advantages
Narrative Integration Enhancement

The swimming session framework provides significant technical advantages:

    Character Interaction Opportunity Framework
        Regular, predictable sessions create consistent interaction settings
        Weather variation justifies different emotional responses to same activity
        Changing conditions enable character adaptation demonstration
        Progressive temperature reduction creates natural reluctance development opportunity
        Club-regular distinction enables social hierarchy implementation

    Environmental Condition Realism
        Historically accurate weather implementation enhances immersion
        Temperature variation creates physically justified emotional responses
        Seasonal transition mirrors character development arcs
        Humidity and precipitation factors enable diversified experience descriptions
        Period-accurate sensation description capability

    Scheduling Authenticity Implementation
        Accurate Japanese school schedule representation
        Period-appropriate curriculum timing and distribution
        Realistic club activity integration methodology
        Culturally accurate recognition of national observances
        Educational system authentic representation

    Character Experience Variation Framework
        Early sessions allow for summer-like enthusiasm
        Later sessions justify discomfort and reluctance
        Weather condition diversity creates varied character responses
        Temperature transition enables changing clothing/preparation descriptions
        Session timing creates consistent after-school narrative framework

The September 1996 swimming session implementation provides exceptional narrative foundation through its combination of regular structure and variable conditions. The documented weather pattern creates naturally evolving experiential framework that justifies changing character responses to identical activities. This implementation enables sophisticated character development opportunities through environmentally justified emotional and physical responses while maintaining period-accurate educational structure representation.
