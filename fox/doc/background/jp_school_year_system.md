# iDkP from GaragePixel - 2025-04-12 - Aida v1.2

## Purpose
This document provides technical specifications for implementing an authentic Japanese school year system in simulation environments. The calendar structures and event parameters defined here enable accurate representation of academic progression, seasonal activities, and educational milestones within the Japanese scholastic framework.

## List of functionality
- Trimester-based academic calendar (April-March fiscal year)
- Grade progression system with entrance/graduation ceremonies
- Standardized school event scheduling with seasonal distribution
- Vacation period implementation with regional variation parameters
- Club activity integration during both academic and vacation periods
- Examination scheduling with appropriate preparation windows
- Weather-contingent event modifications (indoor/outdoor alternatives)
- School administrative calendar with faculty meeting patterns

## Notes
The Japanese school year employs a distinctive structure that requires careful implementation to ensure authenticity:

### Trimester Implementation
The Japanese academic calendar operates on a fiscal year basis starting in April and ending in March. This is divided into three distinct terms:

- **First Trimester**: Early April to late July (approximately 4 months)
- **Second Trimester**: Early September to late December (approximately 4 months)
- **Third Trimester**: Early January to late March (approximately 3 months)

Each trimester begins with an opening ceremony (始業式) and concludes with a closing ceremony (終業式), creating natural narrative bookends. The trimester system provides clear organizational boundaries for academic content progression.

### Vacation Period System
Japanese academic calendars incorporate standardized vacation periods that punctuate the school year:

1. **Summer Vacation** (夏休み): Late July through August (30-40 days)
2. **Winter Vacation** (冬休み): December 25 to January 7 (approximately 2 weeks)
3. **Spring Vacation** (春休み): Late March to early April (1-2 weeks)

Regional variations impact vacation durations significantly. Northern prefectures typically have shorter summer breaks (25-30 days) and longer winter breaks (up to 3 weeks) due to climate conditions, while southern regions follow the opposite pattern.

### Standardized Event Calendar
The Japanese educational system features numerous standardized events that occur at predictable times:

| Month | Event | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| April | Entrance Ceremony (入学式) | Formal welcoming of new students |
| April | Orientation (オリエンテーション) | Introduction to school facilities and rules |
| May | Health Check (健康診断) | Comprehensive physical examinations |
| May-June | Sports Festival (運動会) | Major outdoor athletics competition |
| June-July | Swimming Classes (水泳授業) | Pool-based physical education |
| July | First Term Exams (一学期期末試験) | End-of-trimester examinations |
| September | Cultural Festival (文化祭) | Arts, performances and club exhibitions |
| October | Field Trip (修学旅行) | Multi-day educational excursion for 2nd years |
| November | School Marathon (マラソン大会) | Long-distance running competition |
| December | Second Term Exams (二学期期末試験) | End-of-trimester examinations |
| January | Career Guidance (進路指導) | Future education/employment counseling |
| February | Final Exams (学年末試験) | Year-end comprehensive examinations |
| March | Graduation Ceremony (卒業式) | Formal ceremony for departing students |

These events create predictable narrative anchors throughout the academic year and should trigger appropriate state transitions within the simulation.

### Grade Progression System
The Japanese education system is divided into distinct levels:

- **Elementary School** (小学校): 6 years (Grades 1-6, ages 6-12)
- **Junior High School** (中学校): 3 years (Grades 7-9, ages 12-15)
- **High School** (高校): 3 years (Grades 10-12, ages 15-18)

Each grade is referred to by its year within the current school level rather than as a continuous sequence. For example, the first year of high school is "High School 1st Year" (高校1年生) rather than "10th Grade."

### Daily Schedule Structure
The typical Japanese school day follows a highly structured format:

- **Morning Homeroom** (朝礼/HR): 8:30-8:45
- **Morning Classes**: Four 50-minute periods with 10-minute breaks
- **Lunch Period** (給食/昼食): 12:30-13:15
- **Cleaning Time** (掃除): 13:15-13:30
- **Afternoon Classes**: Two 50-minute periods with 10-minute breaks
- **Final Homeroom** (終礼/HR): 15:20-15:30
- **Club Activities** (部活動): 15:45-18:00

Saturday attendance varies by school, with some institutions requiring half-day attendance (typically morning classes only).

## Technical Advantages
The Japanese school year system offers several implementation benefits:

### Deterministic Calendar Structure
The fixed April-March cycle with clearly defined trimester boundaries creates a predictable state machine for academic progression. This deterministic structure simplifies event triggering and content unlocking systems, as calendar-based conditions have minimal edge cases.

The trimester system provides natural save/checkpoint opportunities at the conclusion of each academic period, allowing for clean narrative breaks without disrupting immersion.

### Event-Driven Game Design
The standardized event calendar creates natural hooks for gameplay mechanics and narrative development. Major events like the Sports Festival, Cultural Festival, and Field Trip function as milestone markers that can trigger unique gameplay modes or story advancement.

These predictable events also establish a rhythm to the school year that players can anticipate and prepare for, creating organic goal-setting opportunities without explicit quest markers.

### Dynamic Weather Integration
Japanese school events are particularly sensitive to weather conditions, creating dynamic scheduling variations. The rainy season (梅雨) in June typically affects outdoor athletics, while typhoon season (September-October) can disrupt the Cultural Festival or field trips.

This weather dependency creates emergent narrative situations and introduces natural variability into scheduled activities without requiring complex scripting of alternative scenarios.

### Time Management Mechanics
The structured daily schedule creates distinct time blocks that naturally segment gameplay sessions. Each period transition functions as a state change trigger, potentially modifying available interactions, character behaviors, and environmental conditions.

The rigid schedule also encourages strategic time management from players, as they must prioritize activities within the constraints of the school day, creating natural tension between academic, social, and personal objectives.

### Cultural Integration Framework
The Japanese academic calendar incorporates numerous cultural festivals and observances that provide contextually appropriate opportunities to introduce traditional elements:

- Tanabata (七夕) in July
- Obon (お盆) during summer vacation
- Sports Day (体育の日) in October
- Setsubun (節分) in February
- Cherry blossom viewing (花見) in late March/early April

These cultural touchpoints create immersive seasonal transitions while providing natural opportunities for character development through shared experiences.

### Grade-Based Character Development
The clear delineation between school levels facilitates meaningful character growth and relationship development. Transition points between elementary, junior high, and high school represent significant life changes that can be leveraged for dramatic effect.

The entrance and graduation ceremonies that bookend each school level provide emotionally resonant moments for character introductions and farewells, strengthening narrative impact without requiring complex scripting.
