## Purpose  
This document outlines the yokai framework for *Fox Spirit Romance*. It serves to integrate Japanese folklore into the narrative while providing a consistent metaphysical system for gameplay and storytelling. The ontology establishes yokai classifications, abilities, sociocultural structures, and interaction principles.

## Yokai Fundamentals  

### Definition & Etymology  
- **Yokai (妖怪):**  
  - Supernatural entities from Japanese folklore, encompassing a spectrum from malevolent to benevolent beings.  
  - Combines kanji for "bewitching/attractive" (妖) and "strange/mystery" (怪).  

### Key Characteristics  
1. **Physical Manifestation:** Unlike purely spiritual beings, yokai can appear in the physical world under specific conditions.  
2. **Connection to Phenomena:** Often tied to locations, objects, or natural events.  
3. **Independent Existence:** Unlike human-created entities (e.g., Western thoughtforms), yokai are self-sustaining.  
4. **Reality Influence:** Capable of affecting the physical world through various means.  

---

## Classification System  

### Origin-Based Classification  
1. **Henge (変化):** Transformative beings (e.g., kitsune, tanuki).  
2. **Yūrei (幽霊):** Human spirits with unresolved attachments.  
3. **Tsukumogami (付喪神):** Objects gaining sentience after 100 years.  
4. **Oni (鬼):** Demonic entities representing primal forces.  
5. **Kami-derived (神):** Diminished gods or fragments of divine power.  

### Power Hierarchy  
1. **Minor Yokai:** Limited powers, often location-bound.  
2. **Intermediate Yokai:** Notable powers with broader influence.  
3. **Major Yokai:** Capable of affecting large areas; often legendary.  
4. **Greater Yokai:** Near-divine beings like nine-tailed kitsune.  

---

## Kitsune (Fox Spirits)  

### Core Characteristics  
- **Physical Form:** True form appears as foxes with tails denoting age and power.  
- **Shapeshifting:** Can assume human forms, often as beautiful women or young men.  
- **Illusion Mastery:** Creates sensory distortions affecting humans and even technology (e.g., cameras).  
- **Elemental Affinity:** Typically fire-aligned, with abilities to generate "kitsune-bi" (fox fire).  
- **Longevity:** Lifespans measured in centuries; nine-tailed kitsune are near-immortal.  

### Vulnerabilities  
1. **Water Susceptibility:** Running water weakens illusions and forces reversion to true form.  
2. **Energy Limits:** Maintaining complex disguises drains energy.  
3. **Dogs:** Natural predators that can sense kitsune regardless of disguise.  

---

## Interaction Principles  

### Human Perception  
- **Conditional Visibility:** Yokai are often invisible, becoming perceptible only under specific conditions (e.g., twilight, sacred locations).  
- **Perception Spectrum:**  
  - **Blind Perception:** No awareness of yokai.  
  - **Sensitive Perception:** Occasional glimpses or sensations.  
  - **True Sight:** Rare ability to see yokai in their true forms (e.g., Hikari).  

### Interaction Protocols  
1. **Respect Principle:** Proper deference to yokai determines the outcome of encounters.  
2. **Name Power:** Knowing a yokai’s true name grants control; revealing one’s name creates vulnerability.  
3. **Reciprocity:** Exchanges with yokai often require mutual benefit.  

---

## Narrative and Gameplay Integration  

### Quantum Manifestation  
- Yokai are visualized as quantum wave functions, appearing semi-tangible and layered with the physical world.  
- This approach ties supernatural elements to scientific principles, enhancing immersion.  

### Emotional Correlation  
- Yokai forms reflect emotional states:  
  - **Love:** Bright, dancing patterns.  
  - **Depression:** Clinging shadows.  
  - **Anger:** Chaotic, jagged shapes.  

### Illusion Layering  
- Illusions appear as semi-transparent overlays, visible to those with True Sight but blending seamlessly into reality for others.  

---

## Technical Advantages  

1. **Consistent Cosmology:**  
   - Unifies all supernatural elements under a coherent metaphysical system.  

2. **Visual Storytelling:**  
   - Emotional yokai provide a natural barometer for character relationships.  
   - Historical impressions enable environmental storytelling through location-specific yokai manifestations.  

3. **Player Engagement:**  
   - Hierarchical yokai power scaling introduces natural stakes and progression.  
   - Conditional visibility fosters curiosity and strategic gameplay.  

4. **Cultural Authenticity:**  
   - Respects traditional Japanese folklore while allowing for creative adaptation.  

---

## Notes  

- **Design Philosophy:** Avoid binary morality; focus on motivations and context.  
- **Implementation Detail:** Ensure visual cues differentiate between active yokai and historical impressions.
