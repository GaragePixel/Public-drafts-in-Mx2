### Duty vs. Desire  
The tension between Katsuo’s mission to maintain yokai-human boundaries and his growing feelings for Hikari represents his central character arc.  

### Philosophical Dimensions  
- **Boundaries and Connection:** Challenges the necessity of strict boundaries in favor of meaningful human-yokai relationships.  
- **Authenticity:** Explores whether long-maintained performances can evolve into authentic identities.

## Notes  

### Implementation Considerations  
- **Visual Design:** Ensure distinctive features (e.g., golden-amber eyes) remain consistent across all forms.  
- **Dialogue Differentiation:** Separate speech patterns for each identity to reflect Katsuo’s fragmented roles.  
- **Endings:** Provide varied resolutions to Katsuo’s internal conflict, from duty-driven separation to full integration with Hikari.
