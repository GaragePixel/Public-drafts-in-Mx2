This is a fascinating and complex query that combines elements of anthropology, religious studies, mythology, and archaeology. The task involves multiple steps: analyzing Christian holidays, identifying solar connections, tracing their mythological origins, and synthesizing the findings into a plausible cosmogony of the Forgotten Rite involving the golden discs.

To break this down effectively, let me proceed step-by-step:  
1. Identify all Christian holidays listed on the French calendar.  
2. Filter out holidays with solar connections, either explicit or symbolic.  
3. Examine the origins of these holidays and exclude those with known assimilations to other myths or religions.  
4. Formulate a hypothetical cosmogony of the Forgotten Rite using the remaining holidays as symbolic clues.  

I'll begin by gathering the list of Christian holidays on the French calendar.
Here is a general list of Christian holidays commonly found on the French calendar, which will serve as the first step in evaluating solar connections and mythological origins:

### **List of Christian Holidays on the French Calendar**
1. **Epiphany (January 6)** - The arrival of the Magi, representing the revelation of Christ to the Gentiles.
2. **Candlemas (February 2)** - The Presentation of Jesus at the Temple; associated with light and candles.
3. **Ash Wednesday** - Beginning of Lent, marking repentance and reflection.
4. **Palm Sunday** - Commemorates Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem.
5. **Good Friday** - Observes the crucifixion and death of Jesus.
6. **Easter Sunday** - Celebration of Jesus' resurrection.
7. **Ascension Day** - Commemorates Jesus' ascension into heaven.
8. **Pentecost** - Marks the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles.
9. **Assumption of Mary (August 15)** - Celebrates Mary being taken up into heaven.
10. **All Saints' Day (November 1)** - Honors all Christian saints.
11. **Christmas (December 25)** - Birth of Jesus, linked to the winter solstice.

### **Step 2: Holidays Evoking the Sun**
From the list above, I filtered holidays that symbolically or explicitly connect to solar imagery, strength, or light:
- **Epiphany**: The star guiding the Magi is a celestial body, symbolically linked to the sun.
- **Candlemas**: The use of candles and the association with light ties this holiday to solar symbolism.
- **Easter Sunday**: Associated with resurrection and rebirth, aligning with the sun's cycle and spring equinox.
- **Ascension Day**: Jesus rising to the heavens evokes imagery of the sun's ascension in the sky.
- **Christmas**: Celebrated near the winter solstice, it symbolizes the return of longer days and light.

### **Step 3: Examining Origins**
- **Epiphany**: The guiding star could be linked to Zoroastrianism or other celestial myths.
- **Candlemas**: Possibly derived from earlier Roman festivals like Lupercalia or Imbolc (Celtic).
- **Easter Sunday**: Strong parallels with fertility and resurrection myths, e.g., Osiris (Egyptian), Tammuz (Mesopotamian), and Persephone (Greek).
- **Ascension Day**: The concept of ascending deities is seen in various myths but lacks clear pre-Christian solar connections.
- **Christmas**: Heavily influenced by the Roman festival of Sol Invictus and Saturnalia.

Holidays remaining after excluding known assimilations:
- **Ascension Day**: While the act of rising could have non-solar implications, its celestial direction and lack of clear mythological assimilation make it a candidate.
- **Candlemas**: Light symbolism remains ambiguous but could hint at earlier Northern European traditions.

### **Step 4: Hypothetical Cosmogony of the Forgotten Rite**
The Forgotten Rite likely revolved around the interplay of light and celestial power to inspire awe and reinforce the authority of the shaman/druid. Synthesizing the remaining holidays:

#### **Theology of the Forgotten Rite**
1. **Creation Myth**: The cosmos begins in darkness. The sun, symbolized by the golden disc, is born from the primordial void, representing life, strength, and divine will.
2. **Role of the Shaman**: The shaman embodies the intermediary between the sun (divine) and the earthly realm. During the ritual, the golden disc amplifies the sun's light, symbolizing the deity's active presence among the people.
3. **Cosmic Cycle**: The Rite reflects the sun's journey—its birth, ascension, death, and rebirth—paralleling human life. Candlemas (light) and Ascension (rising) serve as key points in this cycle.
4. **Audience Participation**: The community gathers in a circular formation, representing the eternal cycle and unity under the sun's gaze. The reflection from the golden disc sanctifies the crowd, imbuing them with divine energy.

#### **Logic Behind the Hypothesis**
- The gold discs' luminous effect evokes the sun's life-giving power, aligning with ancient solar worship practices.
- The absence of identifiable assimilations for Ascension Day and Candlemas suggests these holidays preserve remnants of pre-Christian, solar-focused rites.
- The calendar itself, structured around equinoxes and solstices, mirrors the cosmic rhythm central to the Rite.
