Hikari is a character invented by iDkP from Garagepixel in 2019-01-18 (designed in 2019 but probably the concept about chimerism was imagined probably around 2012) while no similar cases of human chimerism are known anywhere in the world. His theme and Hikari's images were posted on Facebook and quickly served as inspiration for others, in a way or another. Everything is from iDkP: scenario, characters, dialog, gfx... one man team in action.
