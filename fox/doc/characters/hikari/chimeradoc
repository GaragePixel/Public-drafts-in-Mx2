CHIMERA CONDITION CONCEPT ANALYSIS

ORIGINAL CONCEPT:
In the current narrative, Hikari's chimera condition was potentially misrepresented as hereditary, with her father suggesting her mother had a similar condition. This contradicts both medical understanding and the intended metaphysical significance of Hikari's abilities.

REVISED CONCEPT:
Hikari's condition results from fetal resorption - she absorbed her twin sister in utero. This creates a profound metaphysical connection where part of her brain (specifically visual cortex regions) contains her unborn sister's neural structures. Her ability to see yokai and through illusions comes from literally seeing through her sister's "eyes" - a connection to the immaterial world through the absorbed twin who exists between realms.

This creates several thematic dimensions:
- Hikari is unknowingly a bridge between worlds in her very physical being
- She cannot see inside herself (the one place her sight cannot penetrate)
- Her name "Hikari" (light) exists in counterpoint to her sister's shadow existence
- Her condition is not a disease or deformity but a unique form of existence

ORIGINALITY ASSESSMENT:
This concept rates approximately 8.5/10 on originality. While chimeras appear in mythology and modern fiction, and fetal resorption is a known medical phenomenon, their combination to explain supernatural sight is highly original.

Similar concepts appear in:
- "Monstress" comic series (different mechanism but shared consciousness)
- "Stigmata" in some fiction where physical manifestations connect to spiritual abilities
- "The Butterfly Garden" relates physical markings to spiritual gifts

However, the specific connection between fetal resorption, chimeric skin patterns, and supernatural sight represents a unique metaphysical framework not found in mainstream Japanese folklore or urban fantasy. The concept that one's unborn twin provides sight into the supernatural world creates a powerful metaphor about seeing beyond conventional reality through one's "other self."

The added layer that this is the one thing Hikari cannot see about herself (her inability to perceive the source of her own power) creates excellent dramatic irony and speaks to the human condition - often our greatest gifts remain mysterious to ourselves.
