The Katsuo's "secret mission" not to be a completely empty plot device. This mission exists, but it didn't start during the events of the story. However, the content of this mission, perfectly in line with the overall treatment of the story, will only be told in a later scenario. I would also like you to learn this detail (still silently).

Always in the scope of this game project, this is the new data you will intergrate in the projects:

Now that I've read your analysis, I've been thinking about the possibility of including what happens once Hikari goes to the sources in the perfect ending. I thought I wouldn't have to tell it between this scenario and its sequel, so that we wouldn't know what happens there. Perhaps I'll include an additional progression filter to make this information more difficult to obtain in the first game. Because the idea was to surprise the player with this information in the second game. But since the two games can be played independently, it might be wise to integrate it into the first scenario if it helps finalize the psychological interpretation of the work.

I think that therefore, the events of the "perfect ending" are not really an "ending" but rather a final arc, more difficult to reach than the rest. It leads to the true "perfect ending", which can be called the "realization ending" and is accessed through the "realization arc".

Before Hikari follows Katsuo to the springs, Katsuo visits Hikari's father under the guise of a new worker. He goes to talk with her father and try to resolve his inner problems. Hikari's father is a man who lost the love of his life. Katsuo, who has heard Hikari refer to her father as useless trash, cautiously understands that he can take Hikari with him, but wants to do something useful for his father. Promising himself to find a real way to provide a cure that isn't a fleeting illusion, he plans to question her mother when he returns to the hot springs.

When Hikari follows Katsuo to the springs, she is already determined to become his wife, and Kitsuo has already offered to become his mate. But the question of their respective lifespans is a question for him and for her. He is not prepared to face this, but he knows that Hikari is definitely the one who will give true meaning to his life, in the sense that it will feel "complete." Hikari and Katsuo know that there are precedents for romantic stories between kitsune and humans, but they always end tragically when the kitsune is discovered. He doesn't know of any stories he can attest to as true, but he does know that his mother was once discovered by humans in one of their villages when she was a young child and nearly killed. A male kitsune, the one who would become Katsuo's father, was the one who saved him. Katsuo's father, already older than his mother, died shortly after the birth of Katsuo's little sister, when Katsuo was still quite young (barely 300 years old).

The hot springs are a secret establishment for yokai, in a protected space surrounded by a protective sphere that functions as a quiet zone https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_zone and also locally disrupts compasses. Humans cannot enter this space without spinning around and dying. Cast by a nine-tailed Kūko, the protective spell is inviolable and indestructible, in principle, as long as Katsuo's mother, who constantly generates fields measuring over 20 kilometers in radius, is alive. However, thanks to her ability to see through illusions, Hikari is completely immune to this spell. Not only can she see its true form, mechanically speaking, but she can perfectly orient herself within it. Hikari, when she sees the field for the first time, observes the incredible engineering implemented by the person who created and generates this field. The location of the establishment is not known to humans and the only customers of the springs are yokai.

In this world, the authorities only know of the existence of yokai through a filter embodied by a ministry composed of yokai infiltrated among humans. The imperial family is seen as parasites who take over the legends surrounding the interactions between humans and yokai throughout history, transforming them, and forging new ones to legitimize their supposedly distant superiority over the common people.

When Hikari meets Katsuo's mother, she is overwhelmed by a host of emotions and sensations, due to her gift of seeing through illusions. As her mother cautiously appears in human form in her hot springs office, the main entrance where she prepares to warmly welcome the girl her son loves (Katsuo explained to his mother over the phone that he met a human woman and decided to make her his wife), Hikari sees a nine-tailed creature surrounded by a halo of light that penetrates all objects. The invisible yokai have become particles of light dancing and singing all around the Kūko. Hikari feels her body filled with vibrations and falls to the ground, breathless and amazed, weeping at something of a beauty beyond anything she could have imagined.

But during her stay, a stranger, Katsuo's official fiancé, arrives. Kitsune families, widely dispersed, practice arranged marriages, such as the Burakumin, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burakumin, to ensure their survival. While Katsuo is away, Katsuo's fiancée provokes Hikari and attacks her, determined to destroy her.
Katsuo has never loved her. As a kitsune and as a person. She is relatively perfect but featureless, uninteresting, and she doesn't understand him.

He manages to save Hikari from her clutches, revealing that Hikari is his future wife, and breaks the heart of his fiancée, who runs away. However, he doesn't leave the area, protected by the power of Katsuo's mother (humans wander around in circles in the forest and then die if they try to enter the shrine alone).

Hikari is very sad for this girl, but cannot give up on Katsuo.

In the spring hotel, Hikari encounters yokai, including dangerous tengu who notice she's human and try to devour her, but Katsuo intervenes. Talking with the various creatures, Hikari immediately becomes part of the group. She creates a sensation and amazement among the residents, thanks to her capacity to see a invisible word that the few yokai are in the spring hotel knows not so much about. For some time now, she has started to notice more and more small differences in the species of particles living and evolving around people according to their emotions and who they are. She is not only no longer able to guess people's emotions, but can also guess some elements of their past. Clumsily demonstrating these abilities, she quickly becomes the darling of the place. Hikari does not show it but, alone, she meditates on what she has been able to experience in the past, and what she is experiencing now. But wonders if she is really in her place, if she is capable of managing her life in this space, with these creatures that she has always wanted to meet: - "here, now, I am realizing my dream", and she cries. Katsuo, who can hear even the breathing of a mouse several meters away, decides to share her isolation for a moment, and empathetically takes her in his arms, where she sinks: - "You come with me, I'll come with you, Hikari. Congratulations."

Tatsuo speaks to his mother about he wants to know more about the Hikari's ability, Hikari too as well. So her mother think and ask for speaking to Hikari. Hikari learns then from the Tatsuo's mother that in the forest, a tree inhabited by a Kodama is said to be able to explain to her the origin of its ability to see the invisible world of the yokai. Katsuo, who is fascinated by the fact that Hikari is accessing a dimension that even he and her mother cannot sense (but that's not why he loves her), shows her the way to the tree. It's worth noting that Hikari's power already allows her to navigate the forest without risking death, as she sees through illusions, no matter how perfect they are. But like everyone else, she needs to be shown where things are. Katsuo makes the decision, accepted by Hikari, to let her undertake the journey alone to obtain her own answers.
Finding the Kodama, she undergoes a dormant ordeal, travels through his subconscious, and accesses the fused part of her sister's brain. From there, she understands that her sister has no human nature since she does not exist. Having undergone spiritual preparation, traveling through his consciousness, she takes possession of the unborn entity, coloring it with the essence of Katsuo's hair of fur, and becoming a Kitsune.

Katsuo, who was a few kilometers away, near the river, contemplating nature, decides to visit the tree to see if Hikari has obtained her answers. When he arrives, Hikari is naked, hiding her blond tail and changing angles when Katsuo tries to see what she is hiding behind her back. He finally approaches and she gently flicks her tail in his face, which leaves Katsuo flustered. He tries to talk to her, but she leaps and turns to look at him. When he begins to step over the branches of the very uneven terrain (primary forest), she runs away. With the Kodama still molted, Katsuo doesn't grasp the situation. He chases her, and they run on all fours, but in their half-human, half-fox forms. He knows he can run faster than her, but yet he can't completely catch up with her; he's helpless. Arriving at the edge of the mountain, at the ravine, she leaps into the void, runs along the face, but loses her grip and begins to fall. She is then saved by Katsuo, who, exhausted, manages to land them safely at the foot of the ravine. He is in shock; she takes him in her arms and says she loves him infinitely. He will dig a burrow for her to spend the night in.

In the following days, having returned to live at the springs, Hikari encounters many yokai, some of whom notice a difference in her. Hikari explains that she is a kitsune, a former human, who is no longer human and will never become so again. She explains that she only has a vague feeling of having once felt human, and that she has always felt as she is now. She retains her gift of seeing the invisible world of yokai despite the change in nature of her chimerical part, because her sister was never born and continues to not exist, even under a defined essence.
Thanks to her gymnastic skills, she quickly masters the basic movements to move from branch to branch. Katsuo's sister, who doesn't particularly like humans, is persuaded by Kitsuo (after after negotiating to clean the pond that her sister has to clean while she prefers to go to the forest to observe the yamamai https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antheraea_yamamai since it is their season) to teach Hikari the female moves that allow vixens greater speed in the trees than males. His sister is gifted, but not exceptionally talented either. However, his brother knows that she is not so mediocre and that if she took the time to train, she would be more capable. The Katsuo's sister learn Hikari some basic but essential concepts like tail splitting: 
"Tail Splitting" is an important concept for kitsune, but not particularly relevant to the storyline of this current game. Tails "split" during an event, an epiphany, and will grant a set of abilities linked to that tail, which sometimes possesses a unique additional power that cannot be duplicated or imitated. Tails split every hundred years, sometimes skip a hundred years, or sometimes can split consecutively. However, the kitsune must undergo extensive mental and spiritual preparation to avoid becoming a Kiko or even dying as a result of the splitting. Past events, accomplishments, desires, dreams, or disappointments contribute to the nature of the tail and eventually its type and power level.
A kitsune's tail is not necessarily equal to another kitsune's. The tail of an average Yako serves as a comparative scale, but the "coefficient" of a kitsune's tails is measured subjectively and approximately. Someone like Hikari will therefore have a level comparable to Katsuo from the second split tail.

Hikari, observing Katsuo one morning training to use the power of his four tails, insists on learning the species' unique fighting techniques, the Kitsuken.

During this training, Katsuo discovers that Hikari's single tail has a coefficient of approximately 2.8, making her a kitsune of her mother's level, capable of connecting to the essence of Inari. However, she lacks a kitsune ear, nor an inner ear. Losing her sense of balance due to repeated rapid rotational movements, she vomits. Katsuo takes her to the river and teaches her how to drink in nature. Then, she struggles greatly during her training. She sprains her tail, requiring special care from Katsuo's mother, since it is a serious injury that must be properly treated. Hikari is forced to lie down for several days, she crying. Katsuo sleeps with her, takes care of her, reassures her. For her part, Katsuo's mother loves Hikari very much and wants to make her her own. Katsuo then tells her that, although Hikari is disappointed with her own training, he is amazed by what she is already capable of, having mastered in a month what took her little sister 80 years to learn. His mother tells him that Hikari needs to feel comforted.
As Hikari is freed from her immobilization, she encounters Katsuo's fiancée again, who attacks her. However, Hikari counters effectively and surprises the fiancée. Having received a powerful counter, she accumulates the power of her three tails and awakens her full strength. Katsuo, sensing her aura from several kilometers away, rushes in. But when he arrives, Hikari is victorious. Determined to keep Katsuo, she declares her love and breaks the other girl's heart without hesitation. Yet, deep down, she is ashamed and pities the girl.

Katsuo has a younger brother, older than his younger sister. This brother has two tails, is currently searching for himself; we don't really know what he does, but he's there. He listens to his mother, cleans the pools, and constantly complains when we ask him to do something. He lives in one of the hotels and is rarely seen. However, his mother loves him very much, as she loves all her children.

Katsuo's sister is special. She's a loner who lives in the forest, returns once a week to her mother's hotels, and considers humanity harmful. She lives off the admiration of nature, feeding, washing in nature, observing it, studying it, and sometimes returning to her mother's house, where she sleeps in a tree inside a small wooden house. The sister sleeps in a tree's hollow caused by the presence of an object placed by Katsuo's father during the tree's growth, then removed. It is a female gingko. Few approach it, but his little sister adores it. There, in a space protected from humidity, she consults her books and theses, then returns to the forest. Initially intimidated by Hikari (when she was human and then just after she acquired her new essence), she quickly considers Hikari a member of her family.
For her mother, it is important to know who will inherit the springs. She must negotiate a compromise with the family of the fallen fiancé. She refuses to recover her dowry in exchange for disinheriting her son in order to preserve the family's honor. Katsuo doesn't care; Hikari deserves all the inheritances in the world. But her mother is determined to pass on her inheritance to Hikari. Hikari begins to make contact with the yokai who live at the springs, learns more about the ministerial organization, and begins to feel that she can realize her dream of becoming a bridge between the human and yokai worlds, completing her initiatory journey. Her mother, who is also the deputy yokai prefect of the protected region, marries her son to Hikari.

The story ends when she accompanies her husband to the city. So, she's aware of the objective of his secret mission, and the story ends there.
