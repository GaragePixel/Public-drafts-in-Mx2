Born Lee Ji-eun (이지은) but registered under her Japanese stepfather's surname after her mother remarried to escape Korean identity discrimination. Possesses exceptional programming ability, discovered in middle school when bypassing network restrictions. Experienced targeted bullying when her ethnic background was exposed by a male classmate who found her family's Koseki (戸籍) registry documents. After experiencing severe ijime (いじめ) including physical assault and classroom ostracism (むし, mushi), attempted suicide by prescription medication overdose, resulting in hospitalization where she met Megumi during treatment.

**Psychological Architecture:**  
Demonstrates complex post-traumatic adaptation with dissociative elements (DSM-IV 300.15), manifesting as emotional detachment during operations combined with intense focused determination. Maintains dual-identity implementation—public persona as quiet, academically gifted student versus operational persona demonstrating extraordinary technological capability and methodical revenge execution. Core motivation derives from identity-based trauma, with revenge conceptualized as "social justice implementation" rather than personal vendetta.

**Operational Implementation:**  
Specializes in digital intelligence gathering, electronic surveillance implementation, and school record manipulation. Developed the "Ghost Protocol" system enabling Revengeful Girls to track targets through early internet cafe usage patterns, email monitoring, and primitive digital footprint analysis. Instrumental in creating false evidence trails leading investigations away from group activities. Maintains the group's "justice ledger" database documenting target offenses, operational planning details, and execution confirmation.

**Narrative Integration:**  
- Serves as Megumi's primary technological resource, providing intelligence for operations
- Develops targeting algorithm identifying high-risk male students based on behavioral patterns
- Uncovers evidence of Child of the Sun infiltration in school computer systems

## Notes

The character implementation architecture establishes comprehensive background frameworks, psychological profiles, and operational methodologies for secondary characters within the Revengeful Girls and Children of the Sun organizations. Several critical implementation decisions warrant specific explanation:

1. **Victimization-Perpetration Cycle Implementation**
   - Each Revengeful Girls character demonstrates transformation from victim to perpetrator through specific traumatic catalyst
   - Psychological framework maintains trauma response elements while implementing tactical adaptation
   - Justice conceptualization varies across characters while maintaining core retribution motivation
   - Operational specialization derives directly from victimization experience creating capability-motivation alignment

2. **Social Exclusion Mechanism Diversity**
   - Implementation varies across traditional Japanese exclusion frameworks: ethnic (Zainichi Korean), historical outcaste (Burakumin), disability, gender-based victimization
   - Period-specific manifestations reflect 1990s technological transition (early internet victimization)
   - Economic context integration reflects post-bubble Japanese socioeconomic disruption
   - Education system implementation demonstrates institutional participation in exclusion mechanisms

3. **Children of the Sun Recruitment Pathway Variation**
   - Each male character demonstrates different vulnerability exploited through nationalist ideology: masculine insecurity, economic resentment, cultural identity crisis, historical revisionism
   - Organizational appeal varies across intellectual, physical, technological, and cultural dimensions
   - Common thread of identity security through group membership maintained across diverse backgrounds
   - Hypermasculine framework implementation counterbalances Revengeful Girls feminist ideology

4. **Period-Specific Implementation (1996-1998)**
   - Technology integration reflects transitional period between analog and digital environments
   - Post-Aum Shinrikyo societal context creates background tension regarding youth organizations
   - Post-bubble economic uncertainty provides motivation framework for anti-establishment sentiment
   - Pre-widespread internet implementation creates unique operational environment for both organizations

5. **DSM-IV/ICD-10 Period Accuracy**
   - Psychological frameworks reflect contemporary diagnostic understanding rather than current models
   - Trauma response patterns emphasize behavioral manifestation over clinical categorization
   - Adaptation mechanisms prioritized over pathologization in character psychology implementation
   - Operational capability derived from psychological adaptation rather than despite it

The most critical implementation decision involved balancing sympathetic victim backgrounds with morally ambiguous perpetration activities, creating complex characters existing in ethical gray areas rather than simplistic hero/villain dichotomies. This implementation enables exploration of revenge justification, cyclical violence, and moral relativism through individual character narratives while maintaining narrative tension.
