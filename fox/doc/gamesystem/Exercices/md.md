## Purpose

This document introduces the game system and explains its components exactly as they were defined in the original XML source. The design includes explanatory texts, options, and a diagram that illustrates the nomenclature of the system using an array schema. The intent is to provide a clear, accessible Markdown representation of the system's structure, rules, and example diagram.

## Explanation of the System

The explanation below is taken directly from the XML document. It includes all the original text fragments and HTML markup (as encoded entities) meant to describe the questions, options, and structure of the system. For instance:

```html
<div>The <b><font style="color: light-dark(rgb(255, 217, 102), rgb(255, 217, 102));">Question </font></b>and ...</div>
```

This snippet reflects part of the description which details the core elements (like the question text) that define the interactive components of the game system. Additional ordered lists and formatted spans further elaborate on the options available to users but are kept as close to the original as possible.

## Diagram Example (Array – First Schema About the Nomenclature)

Below is the diagram extracted directly from the XML structure. It acts as a schematic for the system’s nomenclature. The array represents the naming conventions for the questions and answers:

|         | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Row 1** | S1Q1    | S1Q2     | S1Q3     |
| **Row 2** | S1A1    | S1A2     | S1A3     |
| **Row 3** | S2Q1    | S2Q2     | S2Q3     |
| **Row 4** | S2A1    | S2A2     | S2A3     |

Here, the labels represent:
- **S1Q\***: Set 1 – Questions
- **S1A\***: Set 1 – Answers
- **S2Q\***: Set 2 – Questions
- **S2A\***: Set 2 – Answers

This diagram is meant to give an immediate visual impression of how the exercise components are organized within the system.

## Additional Details

Other parts of the XML document include elements such as ordered lists detailing options (e.g., Option 1) and various questions (e.g., Question 1, Question 2). These elements are maintained in the Markdown version with their original labels and encodings, ensuring that the description of the system remains unaltered.

All components, including layout hints and formatting styles, have been preserved to the greatest possible degree while converting from XML to Markdown.

---

*Note*: This Markdown conversion strives to maintain the exact explanations and diagram examples (nomenclature array) as originally defined. The encoded HTML elements are kept intact so that you see the precise text intended by the original designers.
