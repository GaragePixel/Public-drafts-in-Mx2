The variable [sexualContentSubstitutionSequenceEnabled] allows to replace the explicit content by an textual description or an soft image instead of the explicit content. But where [sexualContentSubstitutionSequenceEnabled] is, the scene must be in the game whenever the other [violentContentEnabled] [sexualContentEnabled] and states. Of course, if [sexualContentEnabled] is true, we don't need to have [sexualContentSubstitutionSequenceEnabled] true too because [sexualContentSubstitutionSequenceEnabled] = -[sexualContentEnabled]

## Character Psychology

### Hikari: The Observer Who Seeks Connection

Hikari's psychology centers around her struggle for authentic recognition in a world that has rejected her chimeric nature. Her ability to see yokai functions as both blessing and curse—a metaphorical representation of her outsider status. Like many adolescents with feelings of difference, she develops an idealized image of Katsuo, viewing him not merely as romantic interest but as existential validation.

Her obsessive search for Katsuo during summer represents her desperate need to confirm that her perception of reality is valid. The line "Make me believe that I exist, Kitsune-kun, because I was born for you" reveals her fundamental psychological need—validation that her perceived reality is legitimate. This existential yearning transcends romantic desire, becoming spiritual need.

Her perception abilities indicate heightened sensitivity to emotional undercurrents, allowing her to detect yokai manifestations of others' hidden pain (Akane's sadness, Megumi's vengefulness). This empathic capacity creates deeper narrative tension as she must navigate what others cannot see, creating psychological isolation paradoxically born of heightened connection.

### Katsuo: Identity Fragmentation and Integration

Katsuo's character demonstrates profound psychological complexity through his triple identity structure. As fox spirit, human male, and schoolgirl Kazuko, he experiences extreme identity fragmentation, with each form serving distinct psychological purposes:

- **True Kitsune Form**: Authentic self, vulnerable only in extreme circumstances
- **Human Male Form**: Predatory aspect, collecting emotional/spiritual energy
- **Kazuko Form**: Adaptive social camouflage, mission-functional

His psychological development focuses on integrating these disparate identities. His relationship with Hikari creates transformative potential as she accepts his true form unconditionally. When he states "Being myself... here tonight, it's completely silly, I know, but I feel like it's the first time," we witness profound vulnerability—an immortal creature experiencing existential authenticity through being truly seen.

The fur scarf sequence demonstrates his transition from psychological compartmentalization to integration. His embarrassment reveals identity boundaries dissolving as his true self becomes exposed, initiating psychological transformation away from centuries of fragmentation.

### Akane: Transnational Trauma and Martial Discipline

Akane presents a fascinating psychological study in cultural displacement and trauma response. Her feudal speech patterns, Musashi quotations, and martial focus indicate psychological defense mechanisms against feelings of cultural displacement.

Her breakdown in the service sink area reveals profound vulnerability beneath her stoic exterior. The mirroring symbolism—literally seeing herself in reflection—represents momentary collapse of her defensive structures. When this vulnerability is witnessed by Hikari, her immediate transformation to rage demonstrates classic trauma response—vulnerability perceived as dangerous weakness requiring immediate defensive hostility.

The supernatural manifestation during her fight with Tanaka reveals the depth of her repressed emotional energy. The "web of current of blue electric yokai" manifests her otherwise contained emotional intensity, suggesting her rigid self-discipline functions as containment system for overwhelming emotional energy.

### Megumi: Control Through Victimization

Megumi's psychology revolves around transforming past victimization into present control. Her need for Kazuko by her side isn't simply possessiveness but existential dependency—"Revengeful Girls" function as her created social reality where she maintains control.

Her celebration during Akane's arrest ("I found her!") suggests profound psychological projection—identifying external targets that embody her internal threats. The "guardian sons of the sun" reference implies paranoid ideation structured around persecution complex, with her vigilante activities providing psychological justification for aggression.

The black glow and "morbid hooked yokai" surrounding her suggest psychological infection, with vengeful thoughts as parasitic entities rather than authentic emotional processing. Her need for perfect performance in Kazuko's eyes reveals desperate need for validation from the one entity she perceives as having power.

## Narrative Analysis

### Dual-World Perception System

The narrative implements sophisticated dual-world structure through Hikari's unique perception. This creates narrative depth through:

1. **Information Asymmetry**: Hikari possesses knowledge unavailable to other characters, creating dramatic irony and reader-character alliance

2. **Emotional Visualization**: Internal states manifest externally through yokai, creating visual metaphor system that externalizes psychological states

3. **Choice Consequence Framework**: Player decisions affect yokai manifestations, creating feedback mechanism that visualizes psychological impact

This system elevates beyond typical visual novel mechanics by implementing emotional consequences visible within the narrative world rather than solely through character dialogue or numerical values.

### Cultural Integration Mechanics

The narrative demonstrates exceptional cultural integration through multiple systems:

1. **Japanese School Environment**: Accurate implementation of cultural elements including chōzu-bachi purification basin, classroom cleaning responsibilities, and club activity structures

2. **Yokai Taxonomy**: Sophisticated classification system for yokai manifestations tied to emotional states and cultural significance

3. **Cultural Conflict**: Exploration of cultural ownership versus adoption through Akane-Megumi tension

4. **Gift Exchange Mechanics**: Implementation of cultural gift-giving protocols (giri choco) with layered meanings

These elements create culturally authentic storytelling framework while maintaining accessibility through interactive exposition.

### Symbolic Exchange Architecture

The narrative implements sophisticated symbolic exchange system where physical objects carry multilayered meaning:

1. **Fur/Scarf Exchange**: Transforms body part (fur) into wearable protection (scarf), symbolizing relationship integration

2. **Fox-Shaped Chocolates**: Knowledge demonstration through shape selection, creating communication beyond words

3. **Reflective Surfaces**: Revelation mechanics through moonlight reflection, creating truth-showing device

4. **Sony CCD-TRV67 Camera**: Evidence creation technology capturing traumatic events, symbolizing mechanical objectivity versus emotional experience

These symbolic elements create narrative density where objects function simultaneously as plot devices and psychological metaphors.

### Non-Linear Relationship Development

The relationship between Hikari and Katsuo develops through unconventional narrative structure:

1. **Recognition Before Introduction**: Hikari sees Katsuo's true nature before formal introduction

2. **Physical Intimacy Before Verbal Commitment**: Rooftop journey creates physical trust before emotional declaration

3. **Knowledge Imbalance**: Hikari knows Katsuo's secret throughout narrative, creating reader-protagonist alignment

This structure inverts conventional romance progression, creating narrative tension through dramatic irony rather than uncertainty about outcome.
